# Text Adventure (Files)

For this Text Adventure Game,

I did 10 different tasks.

1) I included "help" so when the user types in "help", the instructions are printed out again. (4 points)
2) I included "stuff" so when the user types in "stuff", it prints out the stuff the user has or "you have no items". (4 points)
3) I included "for the taking" so it prints out any items that exist to take. (4 points)
4) I included "take" so when the user types in "take", it takes all of the items and puts it in the user's stuff. (4 points) 
5) I included "drop" so when the user types in "drop", it drops any items the user wants to drop. (4 points)
6) I included "search" or "find" so when the user types in "search" or "find", it makes any hidden exits available. (4 points) 
7) I included "os.listdir" so that the user can play any game that they wish to play. (6 points)
8) I included the "time" module to keep track of how many minutes and seconds the user has been trapped in my game. (6 points)
9) I created a black cat that wanders from room to room and if the cat is in the same room as the user, it prints that the cat is in the same room. (8 points)
10) I got my project into Github! (8 points)
